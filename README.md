# Olivares Lab Project Contributions

## Project Description

This repository showcases my contributions as a research intern at Olivares Lab. My primary focus has been on the preprocessing and mapping of various environmental datasets, including soil data, to create a comprehensive and detailed map of environmental factors in California.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are to:
1. Develop a comprehensive map of accumulated environmental data in California.
2. Process and visualize data in raster (TIFF) format to minimize bias.
3. Apply machine learning techniques to model the distribution of PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances).

## Purpose of this Repository

The main purpose of this repository is to keep track of my daily contribution and progress in this project.
